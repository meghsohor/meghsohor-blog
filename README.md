Hi, I am a Software Developer focused and specialized on the Front-End stacks. Experienced with HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, Typescript, jQuery, Angular, React, WordPress & PHP. I have created this blog to write posts on the Software Development things. I am also going to showcase my projects and my career here.
Checkout the live site here:
### [Live: MeghSohor Blog](https://meghsohor.netlify.app/)

The site is developed in **gatsby** and here are some of the highlighted features:
- **Homepage**: showcases my portfolios, job experiences and a few popular posts from my blog
- **Blog page**: All the posts can be found in this page.
- **Single Post page**: Clicking on a blog post will take to the single post page
- **Post category page**: Clicking on a tag from a post will show the list of the posts under the same category
- **Newsletter Subscription**:  Mailchimp newsletter subscription integrated
- **PWA** & **Offline** enabled

***

## The project is open!
And I would like to help you if you want to use this project to build your personal blog and portfolio site. 

### What are the benifits?

- Multiple post types: blog, portfolio, job
- Newsletter subscription integrated (You can easily add your mailchimp subscription endpoint)
- Easy to create posts using **markdown** language (you can use this [**online editor**](https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html) to write post in markdown language)
- Mobile Responsive
- SEO friendly
- Easy to deploy (It is really easy to deploy the app in **netlify** from **github** repo and it is **free**)

The workflow is very simple. Once you deploy the app in **netlify**, you can publish new posts very easily:
Create a post in your local project -> commit the changes -> push the changes to **git** repo -> **netlify** will automatically pull the latest content from the repo and publish the changes to live
